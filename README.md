# OSP Suite Workshop in Houston, TX, College of Pharmacy

## Two 1-Day PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® workshops on PBPK and PBPK-based QSP 

esqLABS, in collaboration with the University of Houston, College of Pharmacy, is running two hands-on **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** workshops on **PBPK and PBPK-based QSP** on **Monday and Tuesday 16th and 17th of March 2020** (pre ASCPT) at the **University of Houston** (Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Building (HB) 2, Rm 7049, 4849 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77204-5037). 
The workshop covers the **basics of PBPK** and concepts and application of **combining PK-Sim, MoBi and R** to build your very own digital platforms for the prediction of clinical trial outcomes by leveraging physiological and mechanistic knowledge to translate early in-vitro and preclinical outcomes to the clinic. Within the two workshops, you will learn how to:
**Workshop 1 / Day 1:**
- [x] Build a PBPK model in PK-Sim and compare to observed data
- [x] Learn how to model drug-drug interactions in PK-Sim (**DDI**)
- [x] Learn how to consider age-dependency in drug PK in PK-Sim (**Pediatric Analyses**)
- [x] Conduct population simulations in PK-Sim and MoBi
**Workshop 2 /Day 2:**
- [x] Integrate **mechanism-based pharmacodynamics** in MoBi
- [x] Conduct **parameter identifications** in PK-Sim and MoBi
- [x] Simulate and analyze your PBPK-QSP model in **R**

The two workshops will be held by the consultants and scientists from esqlabs GmbH with extensive experience in the use of **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** in all application areas. 

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.

## AGENDA

As use-cases for above learnings, we will develop PBPK models for small molecules and biologics and a PB-QSP model for antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) treatment of tumor growth. In detail (preliminary agenda):
